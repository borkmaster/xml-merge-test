  <p>Merging (also called integration) in revision control, is a fundamental operation that
    reconciles multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files. Most often, it
    is necessary when a file is modified by two people on two different computers at the same
    time. When two branches are merged, the result is a single collection of files that contains
    both sets of changes.</p>
